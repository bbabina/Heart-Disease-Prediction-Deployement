# Heart Disease Prediction with Deployment

The Heart Disease Prediction web app predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on input parameters related to an individual's medical data. 

## Description

The Heart Disease Prediction Web Application aims to assist users in understanding their risk of heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise angina, old peak, and ST slope. By inputting these parameters, users can obtain predictions about the likelihood of having heart disease using a machine learning model.
